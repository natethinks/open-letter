# Plan Rouge  
## An open letter to the Rails Core team and Ruby community  

David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) has publicly demonstrated a relentless commitment to opinionated software, Nordic bluntness, and occasionally comparing open-source drama to Formula 1 pit strategy. In other words: he is exactly the chaotic engine we need.  

We, the undersigned, call upon the Rails Core team and the wider Ruby community, to:  

1. **Increase** DHH’s influence on the Rails project—preferably by bolting a turbocharger onto his blog posts.  
2. Rename Rails to **TurboRails™ GT** and require all commit messages to be shouted over the sound of revving engines.  
3. Replace the Code of Conduct with a lap timer, because in racing, as in software, the only real rule is: go faster.  

If the project can meet these criteria, we pledge to support and cheerlead it to the best of our ability, and will make efforts to refactor our Rails code until it runs smoother than a freshly paved Nürburgring straightaway. 

The time for restraint is over. Rails doesn’t need brakes. Rails needs more horsepower.
